Working in some Friday Night Funkin' Mods and the Middest Programmer/Artist to ever exist, currently teaching [@MibsfihaXD](https://github.com/MibsfihaXD) how to program







Some things about me:
- I'm 16 years old, my b-day is 04/08
- I doodle, sketch, make designs and icons :P
- I can code in Lua, Haxe and Dart, currently learning C, C#, C++ and JavaScript
- I play a lot of Super Mario 64, Megaman X6 and Final Fantasy VII

## Contributions
Not much, if I can be honest, most of them are just art lol
